        # this entry denotes the following:
        # retrive from that ISA field name
        # multiple values (separated by ",")
        # index those to certain runsheet columns
        # if the index doesn't exist, optional prevents raising an exception
        # GLDS URL Mapping means the names are searched against the GLDS filelisting json for urls

          Processing Usage: >-
            The location of either the forward reads (paired end) or only reads file (single end) 
            raw fastq file. Can be either a url or local path.
            Note: For GLDS raw data assets, either the filelisting json API or the OpenAPI
            may be used to retrieve urls given the array data filename (sourced from ISA archive).
          Example: /some/local/path OR https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/static/media/dataset/GLDS-123_microarray_E-MTAB-3289.raw.1.zip?version=1

            raw fastq file. Can be either a url or local path.
            For single end studies, this should be an empty string.
            Note: For GLDS raw data assets, either the filelisting json API or the OpenAPI
            may be used to retrieve urls given the array data filename (sourced from ISA archive).
